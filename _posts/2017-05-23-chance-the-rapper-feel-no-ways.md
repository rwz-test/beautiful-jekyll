This talented rendition immortalised on video fits the bill of an audio/visual work of art capturing a live performance you can immerse yourself in. This is such an awesome cover from Drake's 'Feel no Ways' on his *Views from the 6* album. The Social Experiment's rendition really makes you appreciate the work put in on the production of the original song and how it can be so beautifully iterated with live instruments.
