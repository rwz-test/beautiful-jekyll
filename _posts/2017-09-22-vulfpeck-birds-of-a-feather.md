Vulfpeck's new single "birds of a feather" touches on their softer side reminiscent to the soulful greats such as Bill Withers and Donny Hathaway. Spotlighting Antwan Stanley's wide vocal range and Joe Dart's melodic bass playing, with the accompaniment of Joey Dosik smooth Rhodes, and Jack Stratton's pancake grooving. This playful video  is a well needed refresher to the chaotic disasters  that have been occurring in the past few months.
