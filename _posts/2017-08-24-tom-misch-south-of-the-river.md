subtitle: >-
  Getting fans to contribute content to be compilated into a music video is by
  no means a new or particularly creative idea. That being said, this is a
  beautiful compilation of people who share the common interest of enjoying good
  vibes make them a perfect visual back-drop for this groovy sound. Big up to
  everyone situated south of the river.
