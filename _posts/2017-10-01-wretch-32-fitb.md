subtitle: >-
  The XX's "Intro" provides the unexpectly perfect instrumental backdrop for
  Wretch 32 to spit arguably the best verse Fire in the Booth has ever recorded.
  The lyrical genius flawlessly delivered over the hypnotic sounds is an
  exemplification of the talent London has to offer in wordsmiths and musicians.

"That was the hardest Fire in the Booth has ever had" Charlie Sloth claimed at the end of the session, the only thing that would have made it even better would is if he didn't abrutly disrupt Wretch 32 in the midst of flowing. Even with the disruption, it is hard to find a worthy example of a better Fire in the Booth session compared to Wretch 32 showcasing his lyrical flow being flawlessly delivered over the XX's - Intro.
