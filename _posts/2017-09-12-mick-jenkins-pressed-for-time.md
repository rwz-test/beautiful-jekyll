subtitle: >-
  Enjoy the brilliantly spacey and hypnotic sound alongside this endless gif.
  Take a break and slow down to enjoy this one, it's always nice to reflect and
  realise our attitude contributes to how 'pressed for time' we really are (or
  if we're even at all)...

So usually rwz.io is limited strictly to videos, as they are the simplest means to curate audio-visual works of art through a digital medium. That being said, there are particular cases when a particular sound and image unrelated to one another when put together form an audio visual work of art. This is the case for the mesmerising song coupled with this minimalistic GIF that overlap in the subject of time.
