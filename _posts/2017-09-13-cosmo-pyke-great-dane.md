The 'Just Cosmo' EP is a brilliant extended play that must be listened to in it's entirety. That being said, the finale track *Great Dane* is an amazing tune and argueably a subtle favourite among the majority of listeners who listened to the album in full. The mellow and sweet sounds are now perfectly accompanied by relaxing visuals of Cosmo skating around and chilling alongside his gorgeous friend enjoying a day in the park.  


#### Cosmo Pyke Bio

**Cosmo Pyke** (that’s his real name) is a songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from Peckham. Raised on a diet of blues, jazz, hip hop, and neo-soul, he writes warm, lo-fi songs that he describes as “spacey, beautiful, and lazy”. His songs draw less on other music and more on his everyday experiences growing up in south east London: reading books, going to pubs, playing football, and other simple pleasures in life.
