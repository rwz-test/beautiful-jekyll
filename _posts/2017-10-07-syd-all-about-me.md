Syd, the always-fly songstress and lead vocalist of Odd Future affiliate band The Internet is taking her effortlessly smooth stylings solo with her debut project *Fin*.The normally sensual singer changes her style up on her debut solo single as she drops BARS over a bass-heavy loop. No crooning and minimal ad-libs - just straight rhymes demonstrating her individual talent and irrefutable merit as a solo artist to the public. 

This track really is “All About [Syd]” but at the same time, she’s quick to remind us that she wouldn’t be here without her family or her squad. “Take care of the family that you came with” - the music video is an illustration of the chorus as she flexes in a dimly lit garage with her day-ones including Odd Future ringleader Tyler, The Creator, Steve Lacy, Matt Martians and fellow members of The Internet.

It’s important to note that sonically this single greatly varies from The Internet’s catalogue. That is to say, “All About Me” represents a bold direction towards hip-hop for Syd in lieu of the neo-soul/funk vibes her and her bandmates have become strongly associated with, and the musical shift pays huge dividends. For all the skeptics that thought she couldn’t hack it as a solo artist “I seen ya sleeping ho, wake up”.

#### Attributions

Shoutouts to South Central L.A. Director Calmatic for filming the shadowy video locale which acts as a perfect setting for Syd and her crew to stunt in. S/o to wunderkind producer and fellow The Internet band member, Steve Lacy who swaps his typical breezy, guitar-laced production style for a more hard hitting loop. And of course, props to Syd for running circles around her competition like it ain’t no thing.
