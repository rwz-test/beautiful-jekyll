  This Toronto based artist provides a mesmerizing sound with equally stunning

This track transitions through a lot of really awesome, pleasant beats. The triplet high hats are incredibly pleasing. The vocals are incredibly soothing coupled with the visual's emphasis of nature makes this music video impossible not to fall in love with.
