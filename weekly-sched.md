The works of art shared on rhymes with zion will mostly consists of videos but on the rare occasion may be an audio with a separate visual that accompanies it (i.e. an audio only song with an unrelated gif). To make things more engaging, there is a theme for each day of the week. The weekly schedule is as follows: 

#### Mellow Monday

Mondays can be rough so why not relax and embrace the present with a melodic vibes provided by *mellow monday* posts. This day is all about harmonious tunes and chilled-out visuals.

#### Toonie Tuesday

This is a day that focuses on low to no budget videos. This is not to say poor quality videos, but videos that are made with limited funds. These days with some creativity, a decent camera and some video editing skills, you can make an audio/visual masterpiece with little to no budget. 

The name ‘toonie’ tuesday is an homage to my Canadian roots. It never occured to me how strange the usage of the word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toonie" target="_blank">toonie</a> is until I moved overseas

#### Wildcard Wednesday

This was the toughest day to decide on a theme, so went for a bit of a cop-out with a wildcard day that any audio/visual work of art can be posted.

#### Throwback Thursday

Anything that has a classic vibe of a previous era. 

#### Live of the Floor Fridays

Friday is dedicated to anything that involves some type of live performance. This can range from freestyles, live-of-the-floor recordings, live sets performed at a radio station or concert, etc. Anything posted on friday should have some form of live elements recorded within the audio-visual work of art. 

#### Animated Saturdays

Everything and anything that involves animation. Whether it is hand-drawn illustration, computer generated images (CGI), stop-motion, rotoscope, etc. This day is all about that animated aesthetic.

#### Safe Sunday

This is a day to post anything and everything that is cool within the space of audio-visual works of art. Just like how [Toonie Tuesday](#toonie-tuesday) pays homage to my Canadian roots, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=safe" target="_blank">Safe</a> is slang used in the place where I currently reside.

_**Please note:**_ 

This weekly schedule is simply used as guidance and not strictly followed, as the majority of content posted intersect and one post could fit into many of the themed days.

Rhymes with zion embraces collaboration and continuous improvement, so this weekly schedule is subject to change. Contributors that curate [rwz.io](http://www.rwz.io) may choose to do so in a completely different way and some weeks may take on a different theme altogether.
