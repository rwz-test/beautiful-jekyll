## Introduction

If we consider a 'work of art' a creation from the infinite potential of nature into a finite actuality which unveils a cultural worldview (e.g. Ancient Greek culture using stones to represent their myths through statues, or certain Indigenous cultures of North America using trees to create Totem Poles which tell a narrative), then audio-visual creations portrayed through a digital medium is the epitome of a contemporary work of art.

The goal of Rhymes with Zion is to present these audio-visual works of art through a digital medium, think of it like an online art gallery which has been curated by collaborators on the internet. Everything done to create rhymes with zion is done through an internet connection. In other words Rhymes with Zion is built, designed, and managed completely through a web-browser.

### Purpose

Rhymes with zion provides a digital place for the curation of audio-visual works of art. It is a collaborative project which aims to share audio-visual works of art. Every work of art being showcased is shared for the sake of itself, presenting it as intrinsically valuable and not just a means to an end.

### Who is it for?

This website remains as inclusive as possible and tries it's best to be accessible to anyone with access to the internet. Whether you are a passive viewer exploring the web looking for cool and interesting content to surf through, or actively engaged wanting to [get involved](#get-involved)

### What rhymes with zion isn't

Rhymes with Zion is unfortunately not the place to find out what rhymes with zion. Luckily, there are <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=rhymes+with+zion" target="_blank">plenty of websites</a> which provide that service. It also, is not on the front-page of google (as you may have seen if you clicked that link above). 

Rhymes with Zion is not a website for self-promotion. Although it encourages contribution through the [curation](#curate) and [individual submissions](#submissions) of their favourite audio-visual works of art, it is not a place for artists to share their own work. By sharing the work of others, you can indirectly promote yourself through your [contributor's page](http://www.rwz.io/contributors/test). That does not mean the audio-visual works of art created by contributors can't be shared on the site, it just has to be curated by another contributor who did not help create it.

Rhymes with Zion is not commercially driven in any way. It does not have a profit motive, and therefore it is not a place where you will see any form of advertisement or marketing campaigns. There is no space for sponsored content or promotional posts. Every work of art being showcased is shared for the sake of itself, presenting it as intrinsically valuable and not just a means to an end. 

## About

The internet has changed the way we see and connect with the world, others, and ourselves. It has enabled digital media to become a ubiquitous throughout society. Rhymes with zion provides a place within cyberspace which curates audio-visual works of art that provides perspective of different cultural worldviews, connects you with a variety of artists and others, and presents these works of art as an intrinsic value in itself to enable the viewer to reflect on their experience. 

### Our Ethos

Rhymes with Zion strives to provide an environment which embraces inclusivity and being agile in the way it operates. What makes Rhymes with Zion different than other projects, is our embodiment of these three core values that are embedded within the entire philosophy of the project. 

#### Openness

Whether it is open source software or being open to different cultural worldviews through presenting a diverse tapestry of art, rhymes with zion embraces an ethos of openness. All the code is accessible on a public repository and it is made available for others to use with an MIT license. The project does not limit itself to a particular genre or style of audio-visual works of art through the recognition that art opens up a perception of cultural worldviews, and therefore the more variety of art made available on rhymes with zion the better it is for openning oneself up to different ways to see the world.
